## Overview of the Analysis

The analysis aimed to build machine learning models to predict loan risk status as either "healthy" (0) or "high-risk" (1) using various financial metrics. A Logistic Regression model was trained, and its performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and balanced accuracy scores. The RandomOverSampler method was employed to address class imbalance.

## Results

# Basic Logistic Regression
Accuracy: ~99.41%
Precision: 100% (healthy), 86% (high-risk)
Recall: 99% (healthy), 98% (high-risk)
Balanced Accuracy: ~98.84%

# Logistic Regression with Oversampling
Accuracy: (To be filled)
Precision: (To be filled)
Recall: (To be filled)
Balanced Accuracy: (To be filled)

## Summary

The basic Logistic Regression model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, recall, and balanced accuracy for both classes, making it the recommended model for this problem. However, the performance could vary depending on the specific problem and the importance of correctly predicting high-risk loans.
